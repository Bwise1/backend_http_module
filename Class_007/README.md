# Task Management System API Design Project

## Introduction

Your objective is to design and implement a RESTful API for a simple Task Management System. This system will allow users to manage their tasks effectively, supporting operations such as creating, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks. Each task will have basic properties like an ID, title, description, and status.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Planning

Before diving into coding, start with the planning phase. Here are the aspects you need to plan and document:

- **User Details:** Decide on the user attributes that will be stored in the system. Consider what information is essential for a user profile in a task management context.

- **Endpoints:** List the necessary API endpoints to support task and user operations. Think about how clients will interact with your API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks and how users will register and manage their accounts.

- **Additional Task Data:** Besides the basic properties listed (ID, title, description, status), identify any additional data that might be useful for tasks in this context. Consider deadlines, priorities, or categories.

### 2. Implementation

After planning, move on to the implementation phase. Here's a high-level overview of what you need to do:

- **Set up your project environment:** Initialize a new Node.js project, install Express, and any other libraries you find necessary (e.g., `bcryptjs` for hashing passwords, `jsonwebtoken` for managing tokens).

- **Database Design:** Decide if you will use an in-memory array or an external database to store users and tasks. If opting for a database, choose between SQL or NoSQL based on your requirements and set it up accordingly.

- **Develop the API:** Based on your planned endpoints, start coding your API. Ensure to implement proper error handling and response status codes.

- **Authentication:** Implement a simple authentication mechanism to protect your endpoints. This might include user registration, user login, and securing task-related endpoints so only authenticated users can access them.

- **Testing:** Test your API endpoints using Postman or any other API testing tool. Ensure that all functionalities work as expected.

### Deliverables

- A document outlining your plan for the user details, necessary endpoints, and additional task data.
- A GitHub repository containing your project code, including a README.md with setup instructions and an overview of your API endpoints. {later on}
- A Postman collection or equivalent documentation of API endpoints for testing purposes. {later also}

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Completeness:** All planned features and endpoints are implemented and functional.
- **Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
- **Documentation:** The project is well-documented, making it easy for others to set up and use the API.
- **Error Handling:** The API gracefully handles and responds to errors.

This project not only tests your ability to create a RESTful API but also challenges you to think critically about the design and planning phase, encouraging thoughtful decision-making and problem-solving skills.

### Some basic features include

this features are just to guide you in decision making

1. **Task Creation**: Allow users to create new tasks with details such as title, description, due date, priority, tags, etc.

2. **Task Lists/Projects**: Enable users to organize tasks into lists or projects to better categorize and manage them.

3. **Task Editing**: Allow users to edit task details such as title, description, due date, priority, etc., after creation.

4. **Task Deletion**: Provide the option to delete tasks when they are no longer needed.

5. **Task Status**: Allow users to mark tasks as complete, in progress, or pending.

6. **Task Filtering and Sorting**: Enable users to filter and sort tasks based on various criteria such as due date, priority, status, tags, etc.

7. **Task Reminders and Notifications**: Send reminders or notifications to users about upcoming or overdue tasks.

8. **Task Comments and Attachments**: Allow users to add comments or attachments to tasks for additional context or information.

9. **Task Assignment and Collaboration**: Enable users to assign tasks to other users and collaborate on tasks with team members.

10. **Task Dependencies**: Support task dependencies, where certain tasks cannot be started or completed until others are finished.

11. **Recurring Tasks**: Allow users to set tasks to repeat on a regular schedule (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).

12. **Calendar Integration**: Sync tasks with users' calendars to provide a unified view of their schedule.

13. **Search Functionality**: Enable users to search for tasks based on keywords, tags, dates, etc.

14. **Activity Log/History**: Maintain a log of task-related activities, including task creation, updates, and completions.

15. **User Authentication and Authorization**: Implement user authentication to ensure only authorized users can access and modify tasks.

16. **Data Backup and Restore**: Provide mechanisms for backing up task data and restoring it in case of accidental deletion or loss.

17. **Customization and Personalization**: Allow users to customize the task manager interface, settings, and preferences according to their preferences.
